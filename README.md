# Predicting-prices-of-IPL-players

The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India. Every year, the teams are formed by bidding for players in the official auction. 
The objective of this project is to calculate and predict individual player value. 
The conventional way to do this is by using machine learning algorithms based on statistics.
In model development, we first analyze, predict and compare the data to the current year statistics. With further data input, we can calculate and predict the future outcomes.
